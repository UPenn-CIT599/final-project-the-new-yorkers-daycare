public class Recommender {
	
	/*
	 * The Recommender class's assignRatings method takes in an ArrayList of childcare center 
	 * inspection records (DayCareProviderModel)--the most recent inspection results of 
	 * each center within the specified zip code. (This ArrayList is generated by the Genie class.)
	 * 
	 * Recommender's assignRatings method partition the centers within the specified zip code 
	 * into three groups, each stored in an ArrayList:
	 * 
	 * Green: Centers whose overall violation rate, public health hazard violation rate, and 
	 * critical violation rate ("violation rates") are all less than 
	 * the citywide average rates.
	 * 
	 * Yellow: Centers with one violation rate that is above the corresponding citywide
	 * average rate.
	 * 
	 * Red: Centers with two or more violation rates that are above the citywide average rates.
	 * 
	 * Green centers are the top recommendations within that zip code, followed by Yellow Centers.
	 * Red centers are not recommended.
	 * 
	 * A helper method, compareAgainstCityAverage, is used to enable the comparison of each
	 * center's violation rate against the city average.
	 * 
	 * This is a first pass at a recommendation algorithm and is subject to change as the
	 * project evolves.
	 * 
	 * Within the NYC Childcare Center Inspections dataset, for each inspection, each 
	 * center has the following fields:
	 * 
	 * ViolationRatePercent: the percent of initial inspections of that center that resulted
	 * in at least one public health hazard or critical violation
	 * 
	 * PublicHealthHazardViolationRate: the percent of Public Health Hazard violations 
	 * among all violations issued at initial inspections of that center during the past 3 years. 
	 * 
	 * CriticalViolationRate: the percent of Critical violations among all violations 
	 * issued at initial inspections of that center during the past 3 years.
	 * 
	 * In addition, the record for each inspection also includes the citywide average rate for
	 * each violation category. Respectively, those are:
	 * violationAvgRatePercent
	 * AveragePublicHealthHazardViolationRate
	 * AvgCriticalViolationRate
	 * 
	 * 
	 * For each violation category, we compare the center's violation rate against the citywide
	 * average.
	 * 
	 * If a center's rates are lower than the citywide average in all three categories, it gets a 
	 * "Green" rating--i.e., the best.
	 * 
	 * If a center's rates are lower than the citywide average in two categories, but higher in one,
	 * it gets a "Yellow" rating.
	 * 
	 * Otherwise, the center gets a "Red" rating.
	 * 
	 * ArrayLists corresponding to each rating tier store the centers with that rating.
	 * 
	 * Each ArrayList will then be sorted by the centers' inspection date. For example, the
	 * top recommendation will be the center in GreenCenters with the most recent inspection date.
	 * This sorting function will be handled by the sortByInspectionDate method (to be written)
	 *
